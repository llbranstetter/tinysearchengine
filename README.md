The assignment and Specs are in a [public repo](https://github.com/CS50DartmouthFA24/labs/tse).
Do not clone that repo; view it on GitHub.
Watch there for any commits that may represent updates to the assignment or specs.
 
The design follows the psedocode written in the implementation part of the lab. 
 
Both programs should compile and run without errors, warnings, or memoryleaks. The data subdirectories should contain all of the webpages found on crawl. crawler/testing.sh shows the testing cases that have been run. crawler/testing.out contains the output from those testing cases.
