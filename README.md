 
# CS50 TSE
## Leah Branstetter (llbranstetter)
 
The assignment and Specs are in a [public repo](https://github.com/CS50DartmouthFA24/labs/tse).
 
This lab was created as an assignment for CS 50 at Dartmouth. The design follows the psedocode written in the implementation part of the lab. 
 
Both programs should compile and run without errors, warnings, or memoryleaks. The data subdirectories should contain all of the webpages found on crawl. crawler/testing.sh shows the testing cases that have been run. crawler/testing.out contains the output from those testing cases.
